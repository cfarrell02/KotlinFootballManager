## League Manager™

I'm excited to introduce my first kotlin application, **League Manager™**, a Kotlin-based application developed as part of my mobile app development journey. League Manager™ leverages the TornadoFX library, offering a user-friendly platform for managing sports leagues, clubs, and players. Here's what you can expect:

### Key Features

- **Entity Management**: Easily create and manage leagues, clubs, and players within the application.
- **Intuitive Drill-Down**: Dive into detailed information with a user-friendly drill-down interface.
- **Sleek GUI**: Enjoy a beautiful graphical user interface (GUI) created with TornadoFX.
- **Persistent Storage**: Safeguard your data by saving it to a JSON file.
- **Efficient Searching**: Quickly locate and access entities using the built-in search feature.
- **Data Validation**: Ensure data integrity with built-in validation for all entities.


## Getting Started

To get started with League Manager™, download the source code, open in intellij and build the gradle project. Once its all initialised then run the main.kt file.  NOTE: You must have Java configured on your device to run this app. Explore and manage your sports-related data effortlessly with the provided GUI.
